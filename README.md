# VODS - Vintage OS Development Systems

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC--BY--SA--4.0-1E90FF)&nbsp;&nbsp;![PR Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pull_Requests-Accepting_Now-00B000)

VODS is a 8/16 Bit computer development platform designed for asipring computer developers who don't have access to the real hardware or can't find a proper emulator online. **Emulators can be web-based (HTML/CSS/JS) or app based (C/C++/Rust) It would be really nice if your emulator isn't runtime dependent, but it's not a requirement.**

## Preface

Do not edit README, CONTRIBUTING, or LICENSE files. That should be common sense. If you see a typo, just let me (SergeantLightning) know in the first discussion

## Supported processors

The current project is to make a **6502/65C02** machine emulator, however emulators for other old CPUs, like the **Z80** and **Intel 8086** are accepted.

## Emulator Functional Minimum Requirements

This project aims to make fully functional emulators, like how you have Qemu or Bochs for 32-Bit and 64-Bit CPU emulation. Take a look at the list below:

Your submission must improve/add at least one of these features:

- Add support for a CPU's instruction or the entire instruction set (if not already completed)
- At least 4 KB of RAM & ROM if not already implemented (of course, you can go beyond this!)
- A proper terminal/screen capable of displaying text at least 40x25 character resolution if not already present (graphics modes would be really cool!)
- Keyboard capturing if not already implemented
- Be able to mount and execute a compiled ROM image just like old computers if not already implemented

## How can I Contribute?

Please look at the CONTRIBUTING.md Documents for information

If you have any questions/comments/concerns, please post them in the first discussion on this repo. I look forward to working with you!
