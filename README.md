# Vintage OS Development Systemsâ„¢ (VODS)

VODS is a collection of vintage CPU/hardware emulators for people who don't have access to 8-Bit computers or plan to build one, but want practice beforehand.

Currently, we only have a WDC 65C02 CPU emulator, but we will gladly accept submissions for the Z80, 8086, or any other vintage, meaning 8 or 16-Bit CPU. See CONTRIBUTING.md for more details
