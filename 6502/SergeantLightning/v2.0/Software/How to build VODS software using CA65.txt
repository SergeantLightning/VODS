To build software for SergeantLightning's VODS emulator, use the following commands:

> ca65 -o yourfile.o yourfile.s
This command created an object file from "yourfile", which needs to be be replaced by the filename of your source code. Your code must contain .segment and .org statements to ensure everything ends up in the proper locations in the ROM image and RAM stuff doesn't get written to ROM.

> ld65 -C slvods6502.cfg yourfile.o -o yourfile.bin
This command creates the final binary (which should be exactly 32,768 bytes) of "yourfile" object file. Again, "yourfile" needs to be replaced by the filename of your object file. It takes the slvods6502.cfg linker config file to know where to put various things in the code, whether it's in RAM (assigned memory addresses), or ROM (placed in the binary)

Now, you are ready to test your software by uploading the generated binary file into the emulator and running it!
