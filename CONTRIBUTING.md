# How to contribute to VODS

- Fork this repo
- In your fork, create a branch with the source set to main. Name your branch "VODS-username" but **replace "username" with your username**
- In that branch in your fork, add on to existing code following these guidelines:
	- If you are adding on to an existing emulator, you can edit existing files of that emulator
	- If you are creating a new emulator, add a folder in the respective CPU folder. For example, if you were creating a new 6502 Emulator, you would go to the 6502 folder, and add a folder called your username. Then put your code in that folder
- Commit changes
- Make sure your contributions match the requirements mentioned in the VODS repo's readme and this document
- Submit a pull request with the following criteria:
	- Tell us which CPU your contribution targets (6502, Z80, 8086, etc)
	- Describe the changes you made
	- Add at least 1 image or link a video demonstrating what your change did to the emulator you edited/created
- You're done! Now you just have to wait for an approval
